# NarrativeCV
People have different CV styles already. However, these styles are all formal and do not tell about what happened in a narrative way. NarrativeCV is another way of expressing your CV and experiences by telling your short stories about your experiences.

## Coloring (beta)
If you want to color your page (default everything has some tone of gray), you can include css files under ```/css/colors/``` Currently there four different colors: ```blue```, ```red```, ```green```, ```orange```.

Example
```
<link href="css/colors/blue.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
