NarrativeCV
=============
People have different CV styles already. However, these styles are all formal and do not tell about what happened in an narrative way. NarrativeCV is another way of expressing your CV and experiences by telling your short stories about your experiences.

Coloring (beta)
-------
If you want to color your page (default everything has some tone of gray), you can include css files under /css/colors/. Currently there four different colors.

Example: <link href="css/colors/blue.css" rel="stylesheet" />
